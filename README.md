#ACP2WebUI

This Web UI is a part of a whole project about Personalised Public Display, where a public display is provided for displaying personalised info of users whose mobile phone has been detected when he/she is passing by the display. And the info shown here should not be aware by others, in other words, only you know that some info on the display is for you.
